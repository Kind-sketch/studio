# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Firebase Backend Setup

This project includes a complete Firebase backend configuration:

1. **Authentication**: Phone number authentication for artisans, buyers, and sponsors
2. **Firestore**: Document database with collections for users, products, orders, and sponsors
3. **Firebase Storage**: Secure storage with role-based access controls
4. **Security Rules**: Firestore and Storage security rules defined in `docs/firestore.rules` and `docs/storage.rules`
5. **Indexes**: Firestore indexes defined in `docs/firestore.indexes.json`

## Backend Configuration

The backend schema is defined in `docs/backend.json` which outlines:
- Data collections and their fields
- Authentication providers
- Security rules

## Next Steps

To provision the Firebase backend resources:

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Initialize Firebase project: `firebase init`
4. Deploy Firebase resources: `firebase deploy`

The Firebase configuration files are ready to be used with the Firebase CLI to provision all necessary backend resources.
